Connect to the Azure portal
Go to the Azure Active Directory service page
Open the App registrations section in the left pane.
Continue by clicking on the + New registration button
Then, in the Register an application page, do the following actions:

Enter a meaningful and understandable Name in the dedicated field (ex: MS Graph App)
> Select the Account Types that will be able to access the application we are configuring (options described below)
- Work Accounts in the current tenant only
- Work Accounts in any tenant
- Work Accounts in any tenant and Personal Microsoft Accounts
> Let the Redirect URI field empty for now

Click on the Register button to finalize the registration of the application
At the end of the previous steps, you will be redirected on the Overview page of the new registered application
Here, copy the Application (client) ID, because we will need it later
Once this is done, go to the API Permissions section
On this page, we will select the rights we need our application to have to answer to our needs.
To do so, click on the + Add a permission button.
In the pane that appears on the right on your screen, choose Microsoft Graph in the “Commonly used Microsoft APIs” section
> Choose Delegated permissions as the type of permissions the application require

Notes:
- Delegated permissions: permissions granted to a signed-in user without extend his own permissions within Azure Active Directory on the tenant
- Application permissions: permissions granted to the application with the admin consent (almost) always required
You always have to check which kind of permission type is supported by the API you want to use before choose between this two options.
> Then search and select the permissions you want to set on your application

When it is done, you can click on the Add permissions button at the bottom of the pane
Notes:
For some of you wondering if they need to grant tenant-wide admin consent or not, I invite you to read the Microsoft documentation page about that.
This other interesting Microsoft documentation page related to this subject will give you more insights to understand this mechanism.
In our case, this is not required to continue, so we will let the situation as it is.
Go to the Certificates & Secrets section
Click on the + New client secret button
Enter a meaningful and understandable Description
Choose a retention period for the client secret you are creating for your application (options described below)
- Client secret expires 1 year after creation
- Client secret expires 2 years after creation
- Client secret never expires
Click on the Add button to finalize the creation of the client secret
Then, copy the Client Secret value, because we will need it later
Warning: If you do not copy the Client Secret value at this moment, and leave this page, you will lose it.

At this moment, you should have:

An application registered in Azure Active Directory with permissions for the Microsoft Graph API
The Application (client) ID of the application copied somewhere safe
The Client Secret value of the application copied somewhere safe
And with all that, we will be able to pursue with the creation of the Microsoft Graph custom connector.

Creation of the Microsoft Graph custom connector
Once you have an application registered in Azure Active Directory for the Microsoft Graph API, you can follow the next steps to create a custom connector based on it:

Open Power Apps or Power Automate
Unfold the Data section
Then, click on Custom Connectors
At this moment, you should have:

An application registered in Azure Active Directory with permissions for the Microsoft Graph API
The Application (client) ID of the application copied somewhere safe
The Client Secret value of the application copied somewhere safe
And with all that, we will be able to pursue with the creation of the Microsoft Graph custom connector.

*--------------------------------------Creation of the Microsoft Graph custom connector--------------------------------------*

Once you have an application registered in Azure Active Directory for the Microsoft Graph API, you can follow the next steps to create a custom connector based on it:

Open Power Apps or Power Automate
Unfold the Data section
Then, click on Custom Connectors

Click on the + New custom connector button
And select the Create from blank option
Enter a meaningful and understandable Name (ex: “MS Graph Custom”), and then click on the Continue button
On the first screen, you will be able to configure general properties of the custom connector
> Upload a connector icon, or set an icon background color

> Enter a meaningful and understandable Description (ex: Custom connector for the MS Graph API)

> Let the Connect via on-premises data gateway option unchecked

> Select the HTTPS option

> In the Host field, enter the following value: graph.microsoft.com

> In the Base URL field, enter the following value: /v1.0/

Once it is all set on this screen, you can click on the Security -> button

On the Security page, complete the information as described below
> First, choose the OAuth 2.0 option in the Authentication type section

> Next, in the Identity Provider field, select the Azure Active Directory option

> In the Client id field, paste the Application (client) ID value copied during the application registration for the Microsoft Graph API in Azure Active Directory

> In the Client secret field, paste the Client Secret value copied during the application registration for the Microsoft Graph API in Azure Active Directory

> In the Authorization URL field, enter the following value: https://login.windows.net

> In the Tenant ID field, enter the following value: common

> In the Resource URL field, enter the following value: https://graph.microsoft.com

> Let the Scope field empty

Click on the Definition -> button to go to the next section
Then, click on the Create connector button

Go back to the Security section (by clicking on 2. Security in the process bar)
Copy the value generated in the Redirect URL field on the Security page
Go back to your application registered in Azure Active Directory for the Microsoft Graph API
Open the Authentication section
In the existing Redirect URI Web line, enter the Redirect URL copied few steps earlier (in the gif below I do that in the old experience page for the Authentication because I am more used to it, but, you can obviously do it also in the new one)
And finish this update of the registered application by clicking on the Save button

Once all this is done, you will be able to test the connection to your new custom connector by following the steps below:

Go back to Power Apps (or Power Automate) where you were configuring your custom connector for the Microsoft Graph API (you should be on the Security section)
Go to the Test section (by clicking on 4. Test in the process bar)
Click on the + New connection button
In the pop-up that appears, click on the Create button
Connect with a Microsoft account
If you get asked for, give the necessary authorizations to the custom connector by checking the Consent on behalf of your organization option
If the custom connector you created is correctly configured, you will see a new connection with its status set to “Connected” in the list of connections.

That’s awesome! But, for now, our custom connector does not have any action. So, let’s focus on this point in the next part.

Configuration of an action in our new Microsoft Graph custom connector
For the demonstration, I have selected the following Microsoft Graph service: Create team

Follow the steps below to see how to configure this action in our new custom connector:

Go to the Custom Connectors section in Power Apps (or Power Automate)
Open in edition the custom connector we created earlier
Go to the Definition section (by clicking on 3. Definition in the process bar)
Click on the + New action button
Complete the information in the General section of the page
> Enter a meaningful and understandable Summary (ex: Add Team to Office 365 group)

> Enter a meaningful and understandable Description (ex: Add a Team to an existing Office 365 group)

> Enter a meaningful and understandable value without spaces in the Operation ID field (ex: AddTeamToO365Group)

> Choose one of the available options for the Visibility (details here)

Then, click on the + Import from sample button in the Request section of the page, and complete the fields in the pane that appears on the right of the screen
> Select the Verb corresponding to your case (in our case, it is PUT)

> Complete the URL field (in our case, the considered value is “https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/groups/{O365GroupID}/team”)

> Complete the Headers field (in our case, the considered value is “Content-type application/json”)

> In the Body field, enter a request sample of the service you are configuring (in our case, like the one below)

{
  "memberSettings": {
    "allowCreateUpdateChannels": true
  },
  "messagingSettings": {
    "allowUserEditMessages": true,
    "allowUserDeleteMessages": true
  },
  "funSettings": {
    "allowGiphy": true,
    "giphyContentRating": "strict"
  }
}
Click on the Import button, to finish the configuration of the Request part of your action
In the Response section of the page, click on the + Add default response button
> Complete the Headers field (in our case, the considered value is “Content-type application/json”)

> In the Body field, enter a response sample of the service you are configuring (in our case, like the one below)

{
  "memberSettings": {
    "allowCreateUpdateChannels": true,
    "allowDeleteChannels": true,
    "allowAddRemoveApps": true,
    "allowCreateUpdateRemoveTabs": true,
    "allowCreateUpdateRemoveConnectors": true
  },
  "guestSettings": {
    "allowCreateUpdateChannels": true,
    "allowDeleteChannels": true
  },
  "messagingSettings": {
    "allowUserEditMessages": true,
    "allowUserDeleteMessages": true,
    "allowOwnerDeleteMessages": true,
    "allowTeamMentions": true,
    "allowChannelMentions": true
  },
  "funSettings": {
    "allowGiphy": true,
    "giphyContentRating": "strict",
    "allowStickersAndMemes": true,
    "allowCustomMemes": true
  }
}
Click on the Import button, to finish the configuration of the Response part of your action
Finalize the configuration of the action by clicking on the Update connector button

Now that we have an action configured in our custom connector, we can test it directly from here. To do that, follow the procedure below:

Click on the Test -> button, to access to the Test page of the custom connector
In the Operations menu, select the action you just created
Complete the fields, and click on the Test operation button
Verify that the response you get correspond to what you were expecting

As you can see, it is not really complicated to configure a custom connector for Power Apps and Power Automate that will use the Microsoft Graph API. And I am sure you can see the potential of this kind of solution.

Perhaps, one day, Microsoft will release a standard connector for this services, but until this time you can follow this guide to unlock new possibilities in the Power Platform.

I hope you enjoyed this “guide”. In next articles, we will go deeper in some scenarios where we will use this Microsoft Graph custom connector.
